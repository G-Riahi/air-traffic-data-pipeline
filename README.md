# Aviation noise monitoring pipeline

This project aims to build a data engineering pipeline that collects data from the OpenSky REST API, maps aircraft coordinates within a defined geographic area, performs data transformation, cleaning, and feature engineering, and outputs the data in a format suitable for visualizing ground-level noise pollution caused by aircraft.

Initially, this project aimed to create a heatmap showing zones with frequent aircraft activity within a specific region. However, due to API limitations and storage constraints, the project focus shifted to the current data pipeline approach.
